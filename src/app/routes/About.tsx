                            I first joined Kapwing as an Associate Software
                            Engineer and quickly grew to SWE I after 3 months.
                            My experience as a full IC was truly "full-stack" in
                            that I worked on everything from implementing an
                            eyedropper tool, text editor, and waveform generator
                            to architecting a distributed system for parallel
                            video processing that increased our processing speed
                            by 4x. As a result, I had high depth and breadth in
                            my knowledge of our subsystems, positioning me to be
                            an effective mentor for others.
